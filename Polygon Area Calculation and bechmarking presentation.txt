Polygon Area Calculation and Benchmarking Presentation
1. Introduction
This program demonstrates how to calculate the area of polygons using three different methods:

Shapelyâ€™s built-in method
Gauss' (Shoelace) formula
Monte Carlo estimation
The goal is to benchmark the performance of these methods, compare their execution times, and evaluate the accuracy of the Monte Carlo method by adjusting the number of iterations.

2. Code Explanation
2.1 Importing Required Libraries
python
Copy code
import random
import math
import time
import timeit
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
from shapely.geometry import Polygon, Point
random: Used to generate random values for point coordinates.
math: Provides mathematical functions like trigonometry and constants.
timeit: Measures the execution time of specific functions.
numpy: Efficient numerical operations (not directly used, but could be extended).
matplotlib.pyplot: For plotting the benchmark results.
pandas: To store, display, and save results in a structured format (CSV).
shapely: Provides geometric objects (like polygons) and geometric operations.
2.2 Polygon Generation
python
Copy code
def generate_polygon(num_points, radius=10):
    points = [
        (
            math.cos(2 * math.pi * i / num_points) * random.uniform(0.8, 1) * radius,
            math.sin(2 * math.pi * i / num_points) * random.uniform(0.8, 1) * radius
        )
        for i in range(num_points)
    ]
    centroid = (sum(x for x, y in points) / num_points, sum(y for x, y in points) / num_points)
    points = sorted(points, key=lambda p: math.atan2(p[1] - centroid[1], p[0] - centroid[0]))

    polygon = Polygon(points)
    if not polygon.is_valid or not polygon.is_simple:
        raise ValueError("Generated polygon is invalid or self-intersecting")

    return polygon
Purpose: Generates a random simple polygon with a given number of vertices.
How it works:
Vertices are distributed on a circle by adjusting their angles.
Coordinates are slightly randomized with random.uniform.
Centroid calculation: Points are sorted by angle around the centroid to ensure the polygon is properly defined.
Validation: Uses Shapely to check if the polygon is valid and non-self-intersecting.
2.3 Gauss' (Shoelace) Formula for Polygon Area
python
Copy code
def polygon_area(coords):
    n = len(coords)
    area = 0
    for i in range(n):
        x1, y1 = coords[i]
        x2, y2 = coords[(i + 1) % n]
        area += x1 * y2 - x2 * y1
    return abs(area) / 2
Purpose: Uses the shoelace formula to calculate the area of a polygon.
How it works:
Iterates over all vertices, treating the polygon as a sequence of connected edges.
Adds up cross-products to determine the area.
Efficiency: Works well for polygons with a small number of vertices.
2.4 Monte Carlo Area Estimation
python
Copy code
def monte_carlo_area(polygon, num_points=10000, max_iterations=1_000_000):
    min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y = polygon.bounds
    inside_count = 0

    for _ in range(num_points):
        x = random.uniform(min_x, max_x)
        y = random.uniform(min_y, max_y)
        point = Point(x, y)
        if polygon.contains(point):
            inside_count += 1

    box_area = (max_x - min_x) * (max_y - min_y)
    return box_area * (inside_count / num_points)
Purpose: Estimates the polygon area by random sampling.
How it works:
Random points are generated within the bounding box of the polygon.
The ratio of points inside the polygon to total points is used to estimate the area.
Monte Carlo Strength: Useful for irregular shapes but requires many samples for accuracy.
2.5 Benchmarking Different Methods
python
Copy code
def benchmark_methods(vertices_list):
    results = []

    for num_vertices in vertices_list:
        polygon = generate_polygon(num_vertices)
        coords = list(polygon.exterior.coords)

        time_shapely = timeit.timeit(lambda: polygon.area, number=1)
        time_gauss = timeit.timeit(lambda: polygon_area(coords), number=1)
        area_gauss = polygon_area(coords)

        num_iterations = 10000
        max_iterations = 1_000_000
        while True:
            area_mc = monte_carlo_area(polygon, num_points=num_iterations)
            error = abs((area_mc - polygon.area) / polygon.area)
            if error < 0.01 or num_iterations > max_iterations:
                break
            num_iterations = int(num_iterations * 1.5)

        time_mc = timeit.timeit(lambda: monte_carlo_area(polygon, num_iterations), number=1)

        results.append({
            'num_vertices': num_vertices,
            'area_shapely': polygon.area,
            'area_gauss': area_gauss,
            'area_mc': area_mc,
            'error_mc': error,
            'time_shapely': time_shapely,
            'time_gauss': time_gauss,
            'time_mc': time_mc,
            'iterations_mc': num_iterations
        })

    return results
Purpose: Compares the accuracy and execution time of different methods.
Benchmark Logic:
Uses timeit to measure the time taken for each method.
Monte Carlo iterations increase until the error is below 1% or the max iterations are reached.
2.6 Plotting Execution Times

def plot_execution_times(results):
    num_vertices = [result['num_vertices'] for result in results]
    time_shapely = [result['time_shapely'] for result in results]
    time_gauss = [result['time_gauss'] for result in results]
    time_mc = [result['time_mc'] for result in results]

    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
    plt.plot(num_vertices, time_shapely, label='Shapely', marker='o')
    plt.plot(num_vertices, time_gauss, label='Gauss', marker='o')
    plt.plot(num_vertices, time_mc, label='Monte Carlo', marker='o')
    plt.xlabel('Number of Vertices')
    plt.ylabel('Execution Time (seconds)')
    plt.title('Execution Time vs Number of Vertices')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()
Purpose: Visualizes how the execution time changes with the number of vertices.
Visualization:
Plots execution times for each method.
Helps compare performance as the complexity of the polygon increases.
2.7 Plotting Monte Carlo Errors
python
Copy code
def plot_monte_carlo_iterations(results):

    plt.plot(iterations, errors, marker='o')
    plt.xscale('log')
    plt.yscale('log')
    plt.xlabel('Monte Carlo Iterations')
    plt.ylabel('Error')
    plt.title('Error vs Monte Carlo Iterations')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()
Purpose: Shows how Monte Carlo error decreases as the number of iterations increases.
Logarithmic Scale: Makes it easier to see trends with large numbers of iterations.
2.8 Saving Results to CSV
python
Copy code
def save_results_to_csv(results, filename='polygon_benchmark_results.csv'):
    df = pd.DataFrame(results)
    df.to_csv(filename, index=False)

Displays the results, plots graphs, and saves the data to a CSV file.
3. Conclusion
This program demonstrates different polygon area calculation methods and compares their efficiency and accuracy.

Shapely: Fast and accurate, but requires external libraries.
Gauss' Formula: Effective for small polygons but can be cumbersome.
